# Xavier's DnD 5e Weapons Analysis

Weapons in DnD are incredibly important. Often at the top of any player's gear list, weapons are more than just 1d4 of piercing damage or 2d6 of bludgeoning. Weapons can tell you a lot about a character and their style and weapons can even have a history all their own; a sword passed down through generations bears a different weight than one wrangled together in the wilderness during the most desperate of times, though each can leave lasting impact on players and the stories we create. 

But what really, in game mechanics, do the weapons themselves mean? Why might a player or DM choose to equip characters with certain ones? What if there's a weapon you would like to use but isn't listed in the book? 

Typically we can simply re-skin a weapon that is already in the Player's Handbook, and this is certainly the method I, and I think most DMs, would opt for. If I want a ninja character to have a katana, instead of spending time and effort looking for the perfect stat block / description on older DND versions, companion books, Unearthed Arcana, homebrews, and so on, I would probably just use the statistics of a Scimitar or something.

But, why use the Scimitar stats? why not a Rapier? What do their differences actually mean and why should I chose one over the other?

Furthermore, what about other weapons that aren't so straight-forward? For example, a pair of nun-chucks? These things would require a lot more effort from a DM and player in order to strike balance between a completely over-powered or useless weapon. 

The real purpose of this analysis is really to help with custom weapons. However, in order to do that, we need to understand the basic existing weapons and the unstated system of rules behind them. As you will see, I find they're really more like guidelines, but this is helpful nonetheless.


So that you don't have to keep reading my rambling, I'll put the results first. Then, a few examples of how you can use this to your advantage. Finally, all of the analysis of how I got to this point will be afterward. Warning, it's long.


# Final Tables

One thing to note is that slashing / piercing damage can likely be swapped easily without fuss. Bludgeoning is a bit more dependant, but in most games the difference between the 3 types really doesn't matter at all.

    Lance   - as defined in PHB.
    Net     - as defined in PHB, but with 1d4 fall damage per creature size if it fails DC 15 DEX check

    Trident - If used in a defensive manner, such as a reaction to being attacked or during a Ready action, a successful Grapple-like check "catches" the opponents weapon in the trident's spokes if their attack roll is within +2 of the target's AC. For example, a character with 15 AC could block an attack from an enemy who rolled up to a 17, taking no damage for that attack. This catch is a temporary block and does not continue past that action.

    Blowgun - Can be used to attack while hidden without immediately giving away your location upon a hit or miss.

## Applied Use

___Example 1: Katana___ This a long, curved blade, with a handle to accommodate 2 handed use. It was used by highly trained, military persons. However, it can be used with one hand (again, with great training) and there were certain styles which use a katana in combination with another sword in the off hand (typically a wakizashi, and again this requires lots of training and practice. Game mechanics would likely necessitate Duel Wielder Feat). 

Though re-skinning a Scimitar may be applicable, I'd argue these qualities are a better fit for the Longsword. If taken with Versatile (1d10), two handed use allows for a devastating blow to opponents, matching the flavor and power of popular depictions of the katana.


___Example 2: A harpoon.___ This is basically a spear but heavier, and with a hook & rope to reel in a target. 

Following the spirit of what we've learned so far, I'd argue a harpoon should: 

 1. Be considered Martial as using it effectively (pulling or entangling an enemy) in combat would likely take a good deal of training. 

 2. As such a 1d8 would be the standard die, and a standard distance Thrown (20/60) makes sense for the weapon. But because it is using a Special property -- something like a Grapple-style DC STR check to reel an enemy in up to 20ft -- the damage die should likely be decreased by one size down to a 1d6. 

 3. Maybe it would be considered explicitly a Range weapon so that you can't melee with it (makes sense), or given a 2Handed property as well to simply dis-incentivize melee with this weapon. And we're done!

By simply considering what properties a weapon might have and the sort of training it would require, we can quickly configure stats for it without having to do much work at all. 

___Example 3: Chainsaw Sword___ This is basically a chainsaw that has a grip and aesthetics of a sword. There's not much more than that; if the chains aren't working it doesn't cut through anything -- it's basically a club at that point. It wouldn't be particularly long to have the Reach property or anything. Depending on what character wanted to use it and how physically large the weapon is in their mind, I'd therefore categorize this as a Greatsword or Longsword.

# Analysis


## Considerations

A few things in this analysis are simply left out of the question or largely ignored. 

First among these is cost. No matter how I try to slice and dice up the weapons tables in the players handbook, there doesn't seem to be any real pattern to create guidelines from. The best I can say is that the heavier, more complex, and more "noble" a weapon is, the more it costs.

The second thing to note is that the damage type is largely disregarded in my final recommendations. I do consider them somewhat informative in the analysis portions, but only slightly. In general, there's basically no reason to care whether a weapon deals slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage. Realistically, many weapons could deal any two, and some could even deal all three types in various circumstances or styles of use. In terms of game mechanics, there's also very few cases where those three specific damage types actually matter. Skeletons, Gelatinous Cubes, and _very very few other_ types of creatures / objects have immunity or resistance to one or the other. Most damage resistance/vulnerabilities have to do with poison, lighting, magic, and so on.

This is not to say that you shouldn't care about damage types at the table; I simply think this specific analysis suggests that we can allow ourselves and our players to create weapons with basically any of these damage types so long as they conform to a set of rules.

Finally, I have cleaned this post up quite a bit. There's many inferences and conclusions I came to that I felt could be left out of my "official" write-up. The ones that didn't make the cut are typically minor and, I believe, easily implied through looking at the tables themselves. However, should anyone have questions about how I came to certain conclusions, I'm happy to discuss or dive deeper.

So, on to the analysis.

## Martial Melee Weapons

Believe it or not, the Martial Weapons are actually a lot easier to make decisions about than the Simple Weapons. This is due in part to the fact that there are more of them specifically named, which gives us better chance to reason about them. 

I have taken the listed weapons and reordered them in a way that I find particularly conducive to this analysis. First, they are ordered by damage die. Secondly, I attempted to keep some semblance of order between the damage types (typically listing slashing, piercing, then bludgeoning type in that order). Finally, there are certain "outliers" I've picked to be placed at the end of each table, but which I will not be discussing in this section.

    1 | 1d6 slash   | Finesse, Light                        | Scimitar
    2 | 1d6 pierce  | Finesse, Light                        | Shortsword

    3 | 1d8 pierce  | Finesse                               | Rapier

    4 | 1d8 pierce  |                                       | Morningstar
    5 | 1d8 pierce  |                                       | War Pick
    6 | 1d8 bludge  |                                       | Flail

    7 | 1d8 slash   | Versatile (1d10)                      | Longsword
    8 | 1d8 slash   | Versatile (1d10)                      | Battleaxe
    9 | 1d8 bludge  | Versatile (1d10)                      | Warhammer

    10| 1d10 slash  | Heavy, 2Handed, Reach                 | Glaive
    11| 1d10 slash  | Heavy, 2Handed, Reach                 | Halberd
    12| 1d10 pierce | Heavy, 2Handed, Reach                 | Pike

    13| 1d12 slash  | Heavy, 2Handed                        | Greataxe
    14| 2d6 slash   | Heavy, 2Handed                        | Greatsword
    15| 2d6 bludge  | Heavy, 2Handed                        | Maul

        ---- Outliers ----
    16| 1d6 pierce  | Thrown (20/60), Versatile(1d8)        | Trident
    17| 1d12 pierce | Reach, Special                        | Lance
    18| 1d4 slash   | Finesse, reach                        | Whip


#### __Generalized Rules on Damage Outputs__
My first observation is that the majority of weapons deal 1d8 damage, with minimum of 1d6 and max of 2d6. 

In order to reach the greater damage outputs, we have to have a Heavy & 2Handed weapon. We could add the Reach property for increased spatial advantage at the cost of decreasing the die by 1 size. 

Finally, melee weapons that are both Finesse and Light (2 very beneficial, positive properties) will have their die decreeased to 1d6.


#### __The Weird Stuff : Part One__
Next, weapons 4 through 6 seem lacking, with weapon 3 seeming to span some distance between 1-2 and 4-6 (or even 4-9 depending on your perspective). 

Knowing that most Martial melee weapons deal 1d8 damage, it makes sense that giving the Light & Finesse properties would decrease the die to 1d6. And of course, if a weapon had the option of 2 handed use, then adding the Versatile (1d10) property also makes sense. But what do we do with the 3 weapons that have no properties at all and the one that has a singular beneficial property?

There is an argument to be made that a Rapier -- the actual historical real-life categorization of sword -- was known to be light, dexterous, and often dual-wielded with either a second rapier, a dagger, or other off-hand weapon. Perhaps this was simply a case of WotC not balancing the actual stats, and that weapon should actually have the Light property and -- like the other 2 Light, Finesse weapons -- be reduced to a 1d6. 

However, that would disadvantage the Bard and Rogue specifically, whose greatest damage dealing weapon is the Rapier. All other classes either have Martial weapons proficiency or some other weapon that has better stats / properties to chose from. So we are left with the gap of weapons 4-6 and the idea that perhaps the names / properties of weapons in a TTRPG are not 100% true to reality.

#### __The Weird Stuff : Part Two -- AKA Why people don't use weapons with boring game mechanics__

The flail, morningstar, and warpick are also an interesting group, mainly due to the fact that no one uses them and they have no weapon Properties. More interestingly, I actually would expect some cool abilities from these weapons if we're speaking historically.

Firstly, the Flail deals bludgeoning damage which (if we look over both the Martial & Simple weapons) is more favored in high damage output; so why is it here in the mid-range? Secondly, a flail is basically a Maul / Morningstar but with the smashy, heavy bit on a chain which sounds pretty cool. Theres a popular hypothesis that this weapons was historically used and designed as a counter-measure to an opponent's shield. Being able to be whipped around/behind the shield meant one could more likely strike a blow to a well defended opponent, but it also came at the cost of accuracy. Accuracy though, is not a factor taken into account in this game's weapon system.

The latter two weapons in this triplet (Morningstar and Warpick) both deal piercing damage and thus are mechanically exactly the same. A Morningstar is pretty straight forward, its like a heavier club or a club with some spikes on it. However a Warpick was a specially designed weapon, typically being used with a very long handle and / or a hammer for use against mounted enemies. You could drag a horseman off his steed or just whack him hard enough to get through his heavy armor. So again, why is there nothing interesting or special about these?

You could say it's just that there would be too many balance issues by giving them more properties or even giving them a singular Special property. However, that seems lacking, especially considering that I can't say I've ever seen a player pick any of those three choices, even for flavoring of their character. I think we must ask, considering that others in their damage output range all have some type of beneficial Property type, _why would they_?

I think WotC simply left these ones as they are because they didn't know what to do with them. In the developmental and play-testing stages of 5th Edition, every weapon was going to have its own unique abilities in addition to whatever Properties they may have. And that makes a good deal of sense, but over time that proved to complicate the game and the idea was scraped. These three weapons, the most interesting and yet most boring of all, are the leftovers.

I see 2 potential solutions: 

 - A 1d8 Martial Melee weapon should have either the Finesse or Versatile (1d10) properties, with no additional properties. (I.E. we should provide a buff to weapons 4-6)

 - A 1d8 Martial Melee weapon can have either the Versatile (1d10) property or a well defined Special property AND the Rapier should be balanced as a type of Shortsword (i.e. bring it's die down to a 1d6 and give it the Light property as well).

I think the second option is greatly sub-optimal as it harms Rogues and Bards specifically (see The Weird Stuff: Part One), as well as requiring more work for a DM to figure out new 'special' types and abilities.

Personally, I lean towards the former option and it is therefore my official recommendation

### Outline for Martial Weapons

    Great Martial Weapons
        - Deal 2d6 (or 1d12) Slashing or Bludgeoning dmg, with Heavy & 2 Handed Properties. 

    Large Martial Weapons
        - Deal 1d10 any Weapon dmg with Heavy, 2Handed, & Reach properties

    Medium Martial Weapons
        - Deal 1d8 dmg with option for Finesse OR Versatile (1d10)

    Minor Martial Weapons
        - Deal 1d6 dmg with Finesse & Light properties.

## Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons are also somewhat straight-forward, with the exception of the Blowgun.
Here I took the liberty of ordering them in a manner to best show the rules they follow. Overall, I think the ranged weapons are the most thoroughly written out and have no major suggested changes. For ranged weapons that do not have some special feature, I would heavily suggest simply re-skinning the following options. 

    Simple Ranged Weapons
    1d4 pierce  | Finesse, Thrown (20/60)               | Dart
    1d4 bludge  | Ammo (30/120)                         | Sling
    1d6 pierce  | Ammo (80/320), 2Handed                | Shortbow
    1d8 slash   | Ammo (80/320), 2Handed, Loading       | Crossbow, light


    Martial Ranged Weapons
    1d6 pierce | Ammo (30/120), Light, Loading           | Crossbow, hand
    1d8 pierce | Ammo (150/600), 2Handed, Heavy          | Longbow
    1d10 pierce| Ammo (100/400), 2Handed, Loading, Heavy | Crossbow, heavy

        -- Outliers --
    1 pierce   | Ammo (25/100), loading                 | Blowgun (Martial)

#### __Basic Notes__
Remember that an improvised weapon which is thrown has a range of (20/60) by default. All of the Ranged weapons beat this, except the Dart which has the Finesse property. From this, we can assume that ranged weapons without Finesse must have an increased range. Additionally, if it is not a Thrown weapon then it must be an Ammo type. 

There are 3 notable Ammo ranges, 30/120 which I will Standard, 80/320 which will be called Long Distance, and 150/600 which will be called Extreme Distance. (The Heavy Crossbow is 100/400 but that's not _too different_ from 80/320 so go with me here.)

#### __Simple__
The default Ammo is clearly Standard as shown by the Sling (the weapon with the fewest Properties). The addition of the 2Handed property in the Simple category increases the range to Long Distance and the damage die by one size. Further adding the Loading property increases the damage die as well, capped at 1d8. 

In general, the "base" range for a Simple weapon is Long Distance. 

#### __Martial__

As with the melee weapons in Martial class, I'd argue that a 1d8 weapon must be the standard for this grouping, meaning the Longbow can be considered our base stats to compare against. Thanks to being considered Martial, the range increases from Long to Extreme. This makes sense because if any old person could pick up a Simple weapon and get to Long Range, then surely training and expertise in Martial weapons should afford even greater range. 

In the Martial ranged weapons we see that the 2Handed & Heavy properties are basically the standard, which corresponds to increasing the damage output and range of their Simple correspondents (e.g. compare Longbow to Shortbow, or the Crossbow heavy to Crossbow light). 

From there, any additional properties are going to decrease the range. 
In general, adding Heavy property gives us one die size larger (eg 1d10 die for the heavy crossbow) and drops the range back to only Long Distance range. Similarly, trading 2Handed & Heavy for Light & Loading decreases the damage output by one die size and takes us down one more step to Standard range (as Light is certainly a beneficial property since players can dual wield).

### __Outliers & Special Properties__
Finally the outlier shows that removing even the Light property from the hand Crossbow doesn't increase our range. I would reason that a blowgun is more concealable than other ranged weapons, would arguably take a lot of training to be proficient with, and is more prone to special ammunition conditions like poison / sleep darts. This is not RAW but likely closer to RAI based on flavoring. I'd consider treating this as if it had a 'Special' property.

____
## Simple Melee Weapons

These weapons actually have the most variety, despite there only being 10 of them total. There's a number of interesting cases for each, and you could probably argue about these for days. That said, here is my interpretation. 

    1 | 1d4 slash   | Light, Thrown (20/60)*                | Sickle
    2 | 1d4 bludge  | Light, Thrown (20/60)*                | Club (cudgel)
    3 | 1d4 bludge  | Light, Thrown (20/60)                 | Light hammer
    4 | 1d4 pierce  | Finesse, Light, Thrown (20/60)        | Dagger

    5 | 1d6 slash   | Light, Thrown (20/60)                 | Handaxe
    6 | 1d6 pierce  | Thrown (30/120)                       | Javelin
    7 | 1d6 pierce  | Thrown (20/60), Versatile (1d8)       | Spear
    8 | 1d6 bludge  |                                       | Mace

    9 | 1d6 bludge  | Versatile (1d8)                       | Quarterstaff

    10| 1d8 bludge  | 2Handed                               | Greatclub

First, note the asterisk I've given to 1&2. This is because all improvised weapons that are thrown deal 1d4 damage with a range of (20/60). So even though they do not have that property explicitly in the PHB, they effectively have it in mechanics. 

From here, we see that 1d6 damage is the most common, edging out 1d4 by a single weapon entry. However, the Mace has no interesting properties. It is, paradoxically, unique in it's lack of interesting qualities (and, typically, lack of player usage [oooh burn!]). The Quarterstaff or Spear outrank it easily, and any benefits one could have for choosing a Mace likely come from specific magic items listed in the DMG or supplemental books. Yet, it was important enough for WotC to leave in. This is why I must decide to consider 1d6 the "base" damage die for Simple Melee weapons. 

#### __Finesse All the Things?__
In the category of the 1d4 weapons, we can see a quick balance issue. The dagger has a huge advantage over all the other weapons in this group by virtue of its Finesse property. If we were to give the Sickle the Finesse property as well, [would we break any game mechanics?](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/87173/does-adding-finesse-to-the-sickle-harm-game-balance)

In short, no. The only standard improvement would be to a 1)bard/rogue who'd 2)taken no multiclass or advantageous feats and is going up against a creature with 3)resistance to piercing 4)but not slashing damage with a 5)nonmagical weapon. That's a lot of conditions to consider, and in the end it basically comes down to a fighting a gelatinous cube at low levels. 

Similarly, thinking through a club or hammer, why can't they be Finesse? One standard explanation is that bludgeoning type simply can't be Finessed, which I find lacking. Personally I think that the existence of a ranged weapon using DEX which can do bludgeoning type 1d4 damage by default (Darts) undercuts this explanation. Further, a club is historically not that much of a pure brute-force weapon as we may think. A club may be more accurately described as cudgel or baton, which even in the modern day can be quite small / compact and used in dexterous manners. Even police billy-clubs are employed equally with speed and grace as they are with strength and force. In terms of game mechanics, one would be hard pressed to make an argument that adding Finesse to the club (a 1d4 weapon) would make game play unbalanced. 

Thus, we find ourselves with my first simplification. Any weapon that is a Simple Melee type can be made to have 1d4 of any Weapon Type damage if given Finesse, Light, and Thrown (20/60) properties.

(Side note: Now that we really only have one formula for 1d4 weapons, our entries for 5-9 make a much more convincing argument for 1d6 as the standard damage die).

#### __General Simple Weapons__

Weapons 5-8 may seem overly complicated at first glance, but the more I dig into them and try to figure them out the more I feel that they are, on the whole, probably best left alone as they really do balance out very well. For now, ignore the Mace.

Looking at these, we get the following properties that can be had for a weapon dealing 1d6 in the Simple grouping. 
 - Thrown (30/120)
 - Thrown (20/60), Light
 - Thrown (20/60), Versatile

#### __Max Damage with a Simple Weapon__

The QuarterStaff may be best contrasted to the Spear, as surprising as that may seem. It makes sense for the QuarterStaff to lack the thrown property, as it is generally a less specialized tool. However, for it to deal the same 1d6 Versatile (1d8) with no extra abilities is a bit odd. I find it especially odd considering that it is clearly a better option than the Greatclub which deals 1d8 at the cost of the 2Handed property and has no other benefits. Why would anyone chose the Greatclub if they mechanically get a ton more usage and versatility out of the Quarterstaff?

The QuarterStaff also, according to multiple Sage Advice posts, serves to fit ANY staff you play with in game unless otherwise stated. Druidic and Arcane focus-type staff and any Magical Item staffs you find in sourcebooks can be used with the QuarterStaff stats for melee. 

For this reason, I think the Staff weapon is missing a 'Special' tag explaining the above benefits. This is not to add any features or abilities, but simply to clarify existing rules.

#### __What's the deal with the Mace and the Greatclub?__

As mentioned above, the Mace is the only one that doesn't get any property at all. It's only unique trait in the grouping I've shown is it's damage type. However, comparing it to the Quarterstaff we can see that just because it is a Bludgeoning 1d6 weapon doesn't mean it can't do anything cool. I think it is really just meant to show a "Standard" basic weapon, and got left out of the fun by WotC. If we re-skin it as a baseball bat or similar, we can see how it makes sense to have a smaller version of the Mace (a club) deal less damage (1 die size). 

In the Martial section we went over how a Heavy 2Handed version of a weapon deals 2 die-sizes more damage than a normal counterpart, and that adding an additional property like Reach decreased that back down to 1 extra die-size.

And yet, the Greatclub, as mentioned above, feels lacking for its single extra die-size. Compared to the Quarterstaff, there is zero mechanical reason anyone would choose the Greatclub. There is zero mechanical reason anyone would choose a Greatclub -- even the Great Weapons Master feat doesn't apply to it, as it is not considered a Heavy weapon; whereas the QuarterStaff actually _is_ included in Pole Arm Master. 

Therefore, my suggestion is to make the Greatclub either Heavy (to benefit from GWM feat) or increasing it's die up to a whopping 1d10.

# Remaining Outliers & Custom / Special Weapons

By now, I feel that all the weirdness and special considerations have been addressed, except for the 4 weapons I marked specifically as outliers. 


        ---- Outliers ----
    1d6 pierce  | Thrown (20/60), Versatile(1d8)        | Trident
    1d12 pierce | Reach, Special                        | Lance
    1d4 slash   | Finesse, reach                        | Whip
    zero dmg    | Special, Thrown (5/15)                | Net

First, I think the Trident is dumb. It is likely a left-over from 5th Edition's rough draft play test rules that had special features for every named weapon. It's damage is low for a Martial weapon, likely because it has both the thrown and versatile properties, which no others have. However, that means it has the exact same specs as a Spear even down to the damage type and underwater combat considerations, yet it costs significantly more money and requires Martial training for proficiency. 

Simply increasing it's damage die causes more issues, because then the rest of the Martial Melee weapons would be somewhat underpowered by it. Which leaves us back at the 'Special' features OR simply getting rid of it. Personally, I'd try giving it a special property like the ability to "catch" an opponents weapon if used defensively (say, with the Ready action or a reaction to being attacked); I wouldn't add any additional down sides, as I feel its low damage is already enough.

The Net is weird, but not terrible. Firstly, why is this a weapon and not simply an equipment item? It deals no damage and can only be used in one way. I think this too is a hold over from the play-testing where everything had its own 'Special' trait; consider ball bearings which can just as well trip someone up. Alternatively, consider a lasso or bolas, which couldn't be used underwater; likely they'd deal damage to any opponent that was in motion, as a trip and fall would leave them prone to smack their face on the ground.

The Lance is actually great in my opinion. It does a lot of damage in a very specific context, requires Martial training, has Reach for all around use, but when not used by a mounted character it requires use of 2 hands just like any other pole arm. That trade-off means highly trained characters can feel and be super cool, put out tons of damage, but do so at the cost of limited opportunities for this usage. This is pretty well-rounded in my opinion, even if it doesn't get much use in my personal games. 

The whip is also pretty decent, I think. Its the only Finesse Reach weapon, and it does the smallest of all damage while requiring Martial proficiency. Again, seems pretty fair to me; it's scope of use is somewhat limited, but if you have a build that wants to take advantage of a reach weapon while using DEX, it makes sense to lower the damage output for that sweet, sweet "cool factor". 

Finally, if you do wish to have a weapon that you can't seem to simply re-skin from the standard options, consider if the weapon has a 'Special' property. 

In the event you use a Special property, the weapon should probably do mid-low damage for its range, and you should consider if an everyday person would be able to use it effectively without years of training (Simple) or if they'd need special training (Martial) for proficiency. If the weapon is decided to do high-damage output, it should be balanced with some sort of drawback in the Special description OR just give it one of the Loading, Heavy, or 2Handed Properties.
